# Building-RESTful-APIs-with-the-MERN-stack.
This demo is designed to highlight the MERN setup. The objective is to develop a simple project with the best possible structure so that you can use it as a boilerplate and elevate your MERN stack projects to meet industry standards.

MongoDB, a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js.
